# Cuckoo Clock Site

This is a companion website to the [Cuckoo Clock](http://github.com/dnywh/cuckoo-clock) project. It has more information on each bird, available at a tap. It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build/). A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/dnywh/cuckoo-clock/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-birds.yml) syncs bird data and imagery between the two repositories.
